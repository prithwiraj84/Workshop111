# Blockchain for Energy Trading

## Project Description
The "Blockchain for Energy Trading" project is a decentralized platform that enables peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading using blockchain technology. This system allows consumers and prosumers to trade surplus energy efficiently and securely, ensuring transparency and trust through smart contracts deployed on the Aptos blockchain.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a decentralized, secure, and efficient energy trading ecosystem that empowers individuals to buy and sell excess energy directly without the need for intermediaries. This platform promotes renewable energy adoption and provides a fair and open marketplace for energy transactions.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with Smart Grids:** Enabling real-time energy tracking and automated trading.
- **Multi-Blockchain Support:** Expanding compatibility with other blockchain networks for interoperability.
- **AI-Based Pricing Models:** Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict and suggest optimal trading prices.
- **IoT and Energy Meter Integration:** Allowing seamless interaction between smart meters and blockchain for automated transactions.
- **Regulatory Compliance and Adoption:** Partnering with government bodies to align with energy regulations and ensure legal trading.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Governance:** Uses a DAO model for managing trading rules and platform evolution.
- **Transparent Transactions:** Every trade is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring security and immutability.
- **Smart Contract Execution:** Automates energy trading agreements and payments without intermediaries.
- **User Wallet & Payments:** Supports Aptos Coin transactions for seamless fund transfers.
- **Scalability & Efficiency:** Utilizes Aptos blockchain's Move language for secure and scalable smart contract development.
